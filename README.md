## Python implementation of wallet :moneybag:

Here you can find the implementation of wallet, using __Python__.

## Requirements :computer:
First of all, on your machine you need to have **Python** installed (v3.x.x).

## Installation :hammer_and_wrench:
Clone this repository in your local machine:
```shell
    git clone https://github.com/hei-school/cc-d1-my-wallet-Onitsiky.git
```

Checkout into the __feature/python__ branch:
```shell
    git checkout origin/feature/python
```

There's no dependency to install. We could directly execute the program.

## Running the application :flight_departure:
To run the program, you just have to execute the main.js file like the following:
```shell
    python ./wallet/main.py
```

## Programming language standard :book:
In this project, I tried to implement as much as possible the [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) standard.

Thanks for visiting ! :sparkles:
