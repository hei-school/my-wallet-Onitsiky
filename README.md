## Javascript implementation of wallet :moneybag:

Here you can find the implement of wallet, using __Javascript__.

## Requirements :computer:
First of all, on your machine you need to have **node** installed (from v16.17.0 or higher).

## Installation :hammer_and_wrench:
Clone this repository in your local machine:
```shell
    git clone https://github.com/hei-school/cc-d1-my-wallet-Onitsiky.git
```

Checkout into the __feature/javascript__ branch:
```shell
    git checkout origin/feature/javascript
```

There's no great installation for this project, but you just have to install the required dependency.

To do so, navigate to the root directory of the project:
```shell
    cd cc-d1-my-wallet-Onitsiky/
```

Then install the required dependency:
```shell
    npm install
```

## Running the application :flight_departure:
To run the application, you just have to execute the main.js file like the following:
```shell
    node ./wallet/main.js
```

## Programming language standard :book:
In this project, I tried to implement as much as possible the [StandardJs](https://standardjs.com/) standard.

Thanks for visiting ! :sparkles:
