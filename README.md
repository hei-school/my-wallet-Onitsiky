## Go implementation of wallet :moneybag:

Here you can find the implementation of wallet, using __Go__.

## Requirements :computer:
First of all, on your machine you need to have **Go** installed.

## Installation :hammer_and_wrench:
Clone this repository in your local machine:
```shell
    git clone https://github.com/hei-school/cc-d1-my-wallet-Onitsiky.git
```

Checkout into the __feature/go__ branch:
```shell
    git checkout origin/feature/go
```

There's no dependency to install. We could directly execute the program.


## Running the application :flight_departure:
To run the application, navigate to the root project:
```shell
    cd cc-d1-my-wallet-Onitsiky
```

Then run the application
```shell
    go run ./wallet/main.go
```

## Programming language standard :book:
In this project, I tried to implement as much as possible the [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) standard.

Thanks for visiting ! :sparkles:
